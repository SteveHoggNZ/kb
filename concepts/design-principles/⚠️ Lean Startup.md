# ⚠️ Anti-Pattern: Lean Startup

A 2011 methodology that's been applied far beyond its context.

---

## The Problem

"The Lean Startup" was written for post-Dot-Com Bubble startups in 2011. Its principles are now applied everywhere—including places they were never meant for.

> 90-95% of startups fail. The Lean Startup approach has a very low success rate. Why would non-startups emulate that?

## What Lean Startup Promotes

### Build-Measure-Learn
Notice that **Learn isn't first**. We start with ideas and building, which leads to feature factories running on guesses.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Release pieces of your idea to see how users respond.

**The problem:** If you have the wrong idea or poor execution, you've already spent time, money, and customer goodwill. Users don't want "minimally viable" anything.

### Lots of A/B Testing
The belief that you can A/B test your way to a good product.

**The problem:** Optimizing button placement doesn't fix a fundamental product-market fit issue.

### Pivot
Change direction based on feedback or poor metrics.

**The problem:** Teams rarely actually do this. The pivot advice is good but rarely taken.

## Fake Lean vs Real Lean

Ries' "Lean" = "Go fast to release something so investors take you seriously."

Toyota's Lean = Reduce defects, improve quality, increase customer satisfaction, get more right the first time.

Real Lean would tell you to cut cycles of guessing as **waste**.

## The Better Approach

**Switch from feature-oriented to task-oriented:**

```
Research → Design/Prototype → Test → Iterate → Build
```

Not:

```
Build → Measure → Learn (→ Rebuild → Remeasure → Relearn...)
```

### Key Principles

1. **Research first** — You might learn the problem you wanted to solve isn't really a problem
2. **Customer-centricity** — Understand customers before building
3. **Fast doesn't mean right** — The winner often isn't first to market
4. **Invest in R&D** — Companies you admire spend time on research

## When Lean Startup Made Sense

The early 2010s, when the message was "prove you can ship something real, not vaporware, so investors take you seriously."

That context doesn't apply to:
- Established companies
- Companies with existing customers
- Products with real usage data
- Teams with access to users

## The One-Sentence Alternative

> "Hire great CX/UX professionals and let them do their work."

Customer research, properly done, prevents the wasteful cycles of guessing.
