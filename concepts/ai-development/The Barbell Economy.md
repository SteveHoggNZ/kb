# The Barbell Economy

AI is not uniformly increasing competition everywhere. It's creating a bifurcated economy where impact depends on whether you operate in digital/contestable markets or physical/local markets.

## The Core Thesis

| Market Type | AI Impact |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Digital/Contestable** | Commoditizes baseline work, intensifies competition, crushes mid-tier |
| **Physical/Local** | Lowers overhead without increasing competition, protects incumbents |

## The Three Layers of Value

### Layer 1: Tokenizable Cognition (Production)

**Examples:** Drafting, summarizing, coding, analyzing data.

**AI Impact:** Marginal cost collapsing to zero.

**Jevons Paradox:** We won't produce less of this work — we'll produce vastly more (more personalized marketing, more A/B tests). But the *value* of a single unit drops.

### Layer 2: Judgment & Accountability

**Examples:** Deciding which strategy to pursue, signing off on compliance, owning decision risk.

**AI Impact:** **Not getting cheaper.** As Layer 1 creates infinite options, Layer 2 becomes the new bottleneck. Humans still provide taste, judgment, and liability.

### Layer 3: Physical Execution (Atoms)

**Examples:** Plumbing, dentistry, installation, face-to-face care.

**AI Impact:** AI cannot perform these tasks. Constrained by physics and location.

## Impact by Business Type

### 1. Mid-Tier Digital Firms (Agencies, Software Shops)

**Status:** In extreme danger.

**The Squeeze:**
- From below: tiny AI-native teams producing equal quality cheaply
- From above: giants with massive distribution moats

**The Trap:** Selling "deliverables" (Layer 1 work) is dying because deliverables are no longer scarce.

**Strategic Options:**
- **Option A:** Get radically lean. Cut headcount, operate like an AI-native startup.
- **Option B:** Move up the stack. Stop charging for production; charge for Layer 2 value (judgment, strategy, accountability).

**Death Trap:** Using AI merely to make the current 50-person model "more efficient." 20% efficiency gains cannot compete with 10x cheaper competitors.

### 2. Physical/Local Firms (Trades, Healthcare)

**Status:** Protected and thriving.

**Why:** Markets aren't "contestable" — you can't outsource plumbing to an AI in the cloud.

**Baumol's Cost Disease:** As digital productivity rises, wages in non-scalable physical sectors rise relatively, making these services more valuable.

**Strategy:** Use AI strictly for back-office efficiency (scheduling, dispatching, invoicing). Don't distract with "digital transformation." Focus on physical service delivery.

### 3. Incumbent Giants (Large Media/Tech)

**Status:** Safe due to distribution.

**Why:** Moats like embedded workflows, brand, and bundled offerings protect them. AI might make distribution *more* valuable as a "token of authenticity" in a world of spam.

**Threat:** Internal brain drain. Top talent may leave to start lean AI companies.

**Strategy:** Invest in internal tools and culture to empower talent to build fast within the company.

### 4. AI-Native Startups

**Status:** Risky if strategy is wrong.

**The Problem:** Pure cognitive production is a depreciating asset. If your value prop is "we do X cheaper using AI," you're in a race to the bottom.

**Strategy:** Don't sell Layer 1 commodity work. Build moats around Layer 2: compliance, audit trails, liability wrappers, embedding into workflows where human judgment is required.

## Investment Heuristics

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| Firms selling commodity cognitive work as primary product | Firms owning Layer 2 bottlenecks (judgment/compliance) |
| | Firms with Layer 3 physical constraints (local services) |
| | Giants leveraging distribution to aggregate AI-generated content |

## Connection to The Great Inversion

[[The Great Inversion]] says execution is cheap. This note extends that insight:

- **Layer 1** = execution (now cheap)
- **Layer 2** = clarity/judgment (the new bottleneck per Great Inversion)
- **Layer 3** = physical reality (protected by atoms, not bits)

The Great Inversion focuses on *how to work*. The Barbell Economy focuses on *where to compete*.
