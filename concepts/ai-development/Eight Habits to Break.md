# Eight Habits to Break

Risk management habits that are now the risk.

---

## Why These Habits Exist

We cling to these habits to minimize risk. They made sense when execution was expensive. In an AI world, these habits *are* the risk because they slow you down.

---

## 1. The Permission Loop

**Old:** Ask before doing to save resources.

**New:** Default to doing. The email thread to get approval takes longer than building the thing you're asking for.

**Mantra:** *"Easier to ask forgiveness than permission"* is now literally true in terms of time spent.

---

## 2. Polish as Procrastination

**Old:** Make it perfect because you only get one launch.

**New:** Ship ugly and fast. A rough prototype in a customer's hands provides better data than a polished theoretical plan.

**Mantra:** *Feedback on something real beats speculation on something perfect.*

---

## 3. Meetings as Default

**Old:** Gather to align before acting.

**New:** Replace the meeting with a demo. Don't talk about what you *might* build; build it during the time you would have scheduled the meeting.

**Mantra:** *The best meeting is a cancelled meeting with a working prototype attached.*

---

## 4. Structured Waiting

**Old:** Wait for feedback/approval before the next step.

**New:** Don't outsource your momentum. Make a provisional decision and keep moving. Waiting is now more expensive than fixing a mistake later.

**Mantra:** *Keep moving. Course-correct beats standstill.*

---

## 5. Inverted Planning

**Old:** Massive planning phase to ensure execution goes smoothly.

**New:** Cut planning by 90%. Prediction is now expensive; execution is cheap. Let reality inform the plan by doing the work first.

**Mantra:** *Plan with your hands, not your calendar.*

---

## 6. The Deck Instead of the Demo

**Old:** Build consensus via PowerPoint.

**New:** Build consensus via results. A working prototype settles arguments faster than a slide deck ever could.

**Mantra:** *Demos don't lie. Decks do.*

---

## 7. Consensus Before Action

**Old:** Get everyone to agree so we don't waste effort.

**New:** Act to create alignment. "I tried X and here is what happened" is more persuasive than "Let's agree to try X."

**Mantra:** *Agreement follows evidence, not discussion.*

---

## 8. Hoarding Until Ready

**Old:** Don't show unfinished work; it looks unprofessional.

**New:** Show raw work immediately. Waiting until you are "ready" means you are getting feedback too late.

**Mantra:** *Share early, share ugly, share often.*

---

## The Pattern

Every one of these habits exists to protect expensive execution time. When execution becomes cheap, they become anchors.

The common thread: **bias toward action over deliberation**.
