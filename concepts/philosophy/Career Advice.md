# Career Advice

Collected wisdom on career and professional life.

---

## On Pace

> Plan with patience but execute with impatience.

Take time to think. Act decisively once committed.

---

## On Direction

> Make sure you're running towards something, not away from something.

Career moves driven by escape rarely lead where you want. Moves driven by attraction have purpose.

---

## On Interviews

1. **Have a conversation rather than an interrogation**
   - Both sides are evaluating fit
   - Genuine dialogue reveals more than rehearsed answers

2. **Be memorable rather than smart**
   - Everyone is smart enough
   - What makes you stick in their mind?

---

## On Presence

> You ought not to be perceived "the most talented person" in the room.
> You ought to be perceived "the most helpful person" in the room.

Talent impresses. Helpfulness builds relationships.

---

## On Priorities

> Family first, work next. Because we are replaceable when it comes to work but there's no replacement for a family lost.

The hierarchy is clear when stated plainly.

---

## Synthesis

These principles connect:
- **Patience in planning** + **running toward** = intentional career moves
- **Being helpful** + **memorable conversations** = relationships that open doors
- **Family first** = the constraint that shapes everything else
