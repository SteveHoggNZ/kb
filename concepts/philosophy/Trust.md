# Trust

Do what you say you're going to do. Be who you say you are.

## The Two Pillars

Trust isn't built through grand gestures or declarations. It's built through consistency across two dimensions:

| Pillar | Question | Built by |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Reliability** | Do they follow through? | Keeping commitments, meeting deadlines, doing what you said |
| **Authenticity** | Are they who they appear to be? | Consistency between public persona and private behavior |

Both are required. Reliable but inauthentic = manipulative. Authentic but unreliable = charming but useless.

## Why It's Hard

### The Reliability Problem
We overcommit. We say "yes" to feel helpful, then can't deliver. Every broken promise—no matter how small—withdraws from the trust account.

**The fix:** Say less, do more. Under-promise, over-deliver. "I'll try" is often more honest than "I will."

### The Authenticity Problem
We curate. We present the version of ourselves we think others want to see. The gap between presentation and reality eventually surfaces.

**The fix:** Reduce the gap. Be the same person in the room and outside it. If you wouldn't say it to their face, don't say it.

## Trust Compounds (and Erodes)

Trust is asymmetric:
- **Building:** Slow. Many small consistent actions over time.
- **Breaking:** Fast. One significant betrayal can undo years of deposits.

This asymmetry means protecting trust is more important than building it. Don't take withdrawals lightly.

## Failure Modes

| Pattern | What it looks like | Why it erodes trust |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Over-promising** | "I'll have it by Friday" (you won't) | Reliability failure |
| **Saying yes to everything** | Agreeing to avoid conflict | Signals you don't mean what you say |
| **Two-faced behavior** | Different story to different audiences | Authenticity failure |
| **Excuses over ownership** | "It wasn't my fault" | Signals you'll dodge accountability next time |
| **Performative vulnerability** | Sharing struggles strategically for effect | Authenticity theater |
