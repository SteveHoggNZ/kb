# Kintsugi

金継ぎ — "golden joinery"

The Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, making the breakage part of the object's history rather than something to hide.

---

## The Philosophy

Instead of disguising damage, Kintsugi highlights it. The repair becomes a feature, not a flaw. The broken object becomes more beautiful and valuable than the original.

### Core Ideas

- **Imperfection is not failure** — It's part of the journey
- **History adds value** — Scars tell stories
- **Repair is transformation** — Not returning to original, but becoming something new
- **Visible mending** — Honesty about what happened

## Applications

### Personal Growth
Failures and setbacks aren't things to hide on a CV. They're the gold lines that make you interesting and resilient.

### Career
The project that failed taught you more than the easy wins. Talk about it.

### Code & Systems
Technical debt isn't shameful—it's evidence of shipping. The refactor that fixes it can be better than a greenfield rewrite.

### Teams
A team that's survived conflict and recovered is stronger than one that's never been tested.

## Contrast with Western Thinking

Western instinct: Hide the crack, make it look like new.
Kintsugi instinct: Fill the crack with gold, celebrate the repair.
