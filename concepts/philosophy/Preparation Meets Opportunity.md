# Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity

> This quote, attributed to Roman philosopher Seneca, reminds us that we make our own luck.

## The Insight

We don't control when opportunities appear. But we control how prepared we are when they do.

**Luck = Preparation × Opportunity**

- Zero preparation → Zero luck (no matter the opportunity)
- Zero opportunity → Zero luck (no matter the preparation)
- High preparation + High opportunity → Maximum "luck"

## Practical Application

### Career
- Build skills before you need them
- Network before you need connections
- Learn the domain before the project starts

### Technical
- Understand the codebase before the production incident
- Know your tools before the deadline
- Practice debugging before the crisis

### Life
- Health is preparation for whatever comes
- Relationships are preparation for hard times
- Savings are preparation for opportunities
