# Building a Second Brain

Tiago Forte's system for organizing digital knowledge.

> A proven method to organize your digital life and unlock your creative potential.

## CODE Method

The process for handling information:

### Collect
Capture what resonates. Don't over-filter at this stage.

### Organize
Put things where they'll be useful (see PARA below).

### Distill
Extract the essence. Progressive summarization.

### Express
Create output. The point of collecting is to create.

---

## PARA System

Four categories for organizing notes:

### Projects
Active work with deadlines and defined outcomes.
- Has an end date
- Has success criteria
- Currently in progress

### Areas
Ongoing responsibilities with no end date.
- Finance, health, relationships
- Vitally important but never "done"
- Standards to maintain

### Resources
Topics of interest for future reference.
- Things you're learning
- Reference material
- "Might need someday"

### Archives
Inactive items from the other three.
- Completed projects
- Dormant areas
- Old resources

## My Implementation

From the original note:

- **Notes:** Inbox for new notes, sorted later
- **Projects:** Folders for active projects
- **Areas:** Ongoing responsibilities (finance, studio, admin)
- **Resources:** Topics of interest (production, marketing, books)
- **Archives:** Completed/no longer needed
- **Journal:** Daily journaling

## Key Insight

The system serves expression, not collection.

Collecting without expressing is hoarding. The goal is creating output—writing, building, sharing.
