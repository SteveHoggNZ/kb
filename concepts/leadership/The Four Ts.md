# The CTO's 4 Ts

> The most important job of a CTO or Head of Engineering is building the 4 T's.

## 1. Team

**Attract great talent into the organization.**

- Have a great story
- Work closely with founders
- Understand what you're building today
- Understand the 2-year vision

## 2. Tech

**Know when and how to evolve the architecture.**

> Every company starts with a monolith—it's the smart thing to do.

The skill is knowing:
- When to break it
- How much to break it
- What to break it into

## 3. Tools

**Focus on how work gets done.**

- How teams communicate
- How work progresses
- How progress is shown

At early stage, this means working directly with founders.

## 4. Timing

**Know when to scale.**

> Before hiring the next 25 engineers, get a lot of things right—Culture, Tech, and Processes.

The mantra: **Scale Responsibly.**
