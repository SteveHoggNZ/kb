# Systems Thinking Levels

Four levels of understanding, with increasing leverage.

---

## The Levels

```
Events → Patterns → Systems Structure → Mental Models
          ↑ Increasing Leverage ↑
```

Each level offers more power to create lasting change.

---

## Level 1: Events

**What happened?**

The reactive level. Something broke. Someone quit. A deadline was missed.

Most people operate here—firefighting, responding to symptoms.

**Leverage:** Low. You're always behind.

---

## Level 2: Patterns of Behavior

**What trends are emerging?**

Looking across events to find recurring themes. Outages happen every release. Attrition spikes after performance reviews. Deadlines slip on projects over 3 months.

**Leverage:** Medium. You can predict and prepare, but you're still reacting.

---

## Level 3: Systems Structure

**What's causing the patterns?**

The architecture of incentives, processes, and relationships that generate the patterns. Outages happen because there's no staging environment. Attrition spikes because reviews are punitive. Deadlines slip because estimates don't include integration.

**Leverage:** High. Change the structure, change the outcomes.

---

## Level 4: Mental Models

**What beliefs and assumptions drive the structure?**

The deepest level. "Testing is the QA team's job." "Real engineers don't need documentation." "Fast is more important than correct."

**Leverage:** Highest. Change thinking, change everything downstream.

## Application

### For Leaders

The higher you lead, the more you must operate at levels 3 and 4.

- **Individual contributor:** Events and patterns
- **Manager:** Patterns and structure
- **Director+:** Structure and mental models

### Diagnosing Problems

When something goes wrong, ask:
1. What happened? (Event)
2. Has this happened before? (Pattern)
3. What in our structure allows this? (System)
4. What beliefs created that structure? (Mental model)
