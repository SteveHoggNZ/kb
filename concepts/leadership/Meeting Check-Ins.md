# Meeting Check-Ins (Green-Yellow-Red)

Plan for the inevitable: humans show up distracted sometimes.

---

## The Practice

At the start of each meeting, everyone checks in with a color:

**🟢 Green** — I'm here, focused, ready to go.

**🟡 Yellow** — I'm here, but something has me mildly distracted or anxious.

**🔴 Red** — I'm physically here, but my mind is elsewhere. Major stress, health news, fight with partner, etc.

## Why This Works

### Stoic Wisdom
> "Rather than demanding of our team they show up for meetings focused and ready to work, we are planning that each of us are sometimes going to show up distracted or overwhelmed."

We are human. It's going to happen. Create space for the inevitable.

### Presence is Powerful
Acknowledging where you are helps you actually arrive. The act of naming your state creates awareness.

### Focus is Fast
A team that knows who's fully present can adjust expectations. Don't give the critical update to someone who just said red.

## How to Use It

1. **Quick round** — 30 seconds per person max
2. **No judgment** — Red is information, not failure
3. **Optional context** — Share as much or little as you want
4. **Acknowledge and move on** — "Thanks, noted"

## When Someone Is Red

Options:
- Ask if they'd rather skip this meeting
- Avoid assigning them action items
- Check in with them afterward
- Simply acknowledge and continue

Don't try to fix it in the meeting.
