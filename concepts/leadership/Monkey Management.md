# Monkey Management

Who has the monkey? A framework for delegation and accountability.

## The Concept

> A "monkey" is the next move—the action that needs to happen next to move something forward.

From the classic 1974 Harvard Business Review article "Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey?" by William Oncken Jr. and Donald Wass.

## The Problem

Managers accumulate monkeys when subordinates successfully delegate upward:

**Employee:** "We have a problem..."
**Manager:** "Let me think about it and get back to you."

The monkey just jumped from the employee's back to the manager's.

Now the employee is waiting on the manager. The manager has acquired another task. The roles have reversed—the subordinate is now supervising the manager.

## How Monkeys Jump

Common phrases that transfer monkeys:

- "What do you think I should do?"
- "Can you look into this?"
- "I'm stuck on this..."
- "Let me know what you decide."

Each of these leaves the manager holding the next action.

## The Five Degrees of Initiative

From lowest to highest employee initiative:

1. **Wait until told** — Employee does nothing until directed
2. **Ask what to do** — Employee seeks instruction
3. **Recommend, then act** — Employee proposes and waits for approval
4. **Act, then report** — Employee takes action and informs manager
5. **Act independently** — Employee handles it and manager may never know

Managers should push subordinates toward levels 4 and 5.

## Rules for Monkey Management

### 1. Identify the Monkey
Before a conversation ends, agree on what the next move is and who owns it.

### 2. Assign Every Monkey
Monkeys must be owned by the lowest level person capable of handling them.

### 3. Insure the Monkey
Set a follow-up time. "Check back with me on Thursday" keeps accountability without taking the monkey.

### 4. Never Accept Upward Delegation
If someone brings a problem, they leave with the problem—plus a clearer path forward.

## Practical Application

**Instead of:** "Let me think about it."
**Say:** "What options have you considered?"

**Instead of:** "I'll handle it."
**Say:** "What's your recommendation?"

**Instead of:** "Send me the details."
**Say:** "Draft a proposal and we'll review it Thursday."

Managers who manage monkeys well:
- Have time for actual management (planning, developing people)
- Build more capable teams
- Avoid becoming a bottleneck
- Create a culture of ownership
