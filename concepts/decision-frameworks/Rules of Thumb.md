# Rules of Thumb

Quick heuristics for decision-making.

## On Speed

> If a decision is not permanent, it is better to move too fast.
> If a decision is permanent, it is better to move too slow.

### Translation
- **Reversible decisions:** Bias toward action. Learn by doing.
- **Irreversible decisions:** Bias toward analysis. Get it right.

This is the core of [[Reversibility-Calibrated Action]] — the meta-framework for calibrating speed to reversibility. [[The Collapse of Roles and Time]] applies this to AI adoption through the "Kids on a Bike" principle: learning AI is reversible, so move fast.

### Examples

**Move fast (reversible):**
- Internal code refactoring
- Feature behind a flag
- Trying a new tool
- Most hiring decisions (with good processes)

**Move slow (irreversible):**
- Public API contracts
- Architecture that affects data
- Letting someone go
- Major technology bets

## Linked Heuristics

From [[Career Advice]]:
> Plan with patience, execute with impatience.

From [[Preparation Meets Opportunity]]:
> We make our own luck.

From [[TOSCA Framework]]:
> If I can't state the problem clearly, I don't understand it.

## Using Rules of Thumb

These aren't algorithms. They're pattern-matching shortcuts.

1. **Recognize the pattern** — Is this reversible?
2. **Apply the heuristic** — Move fast or slow?
3. **Override when needed** — Context matters

The value is in having a default. Without one, every decision is exhausting.

## When Heuristics Fail

Rules of thumb are pattern-matching shortcuts, not algorithms. They can mislead:

- Use [[TOSCA Framework]] when heuristics aren't enough and you need structured analysis
- Watch for [[Logical Fallacies]] — heuristics can become cognitive biases
- See [[Speed of Decisions]] for a deeper exploration of the reversibility principle
