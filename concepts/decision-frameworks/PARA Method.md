# PARA Method

A system for organizing information across your digital life.

---

## The Framework

**PARA** = Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives

From Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain."

---

## The Four Categories

### Projects
Active work with a defined end goal and deadline.

Examples: Launch website, write report, plan event.

**Key trait:** Has a finish line.

### Areas
Ongoing responsibilities with no end date.

Examples: Health, finances, team management, home maintenance.

**Key trait:** Standards to maintain indefinitely.

### Resources
Topics of interest for future reference.

Examples: Programming languages, marketing tactics, design inspiration.

**Key trait:** May be useful someday.

### Archives
Completed or inactive items from the other three.

Examples: Finished projects, old areas of responsibility, outdated resources.

**Key trait:** Not currently relevant but might be again.

## The CODE Process

How information flows through PARA:

1. **Collect** — Capture what resonates
2. **Organize** — File into PARA
3. **Distill** — Progressively summarize
4. **Express** — Create and share

## Practical Structure

```
/Notes          (inbox for unsorted)
/Projects       (active, time-bound)
/Areas          (ongoing, no deadline)
/Resources      (reference material)
/Archives       (inactive)
```

## Why It Works

### Actionability Over Topic
Traditional filing organizes by topic. PARA organizes by actionability.

"Programming" could be a Project (build an app), Area (maintain skills), or Resource (language reference). Context determines location.

### Reduces Decision Fatigue
Only four choices. No deep hierarchies. Fast filing.

### Mirrors Life
Projects end. Areas persist. Resources grow. Archives accumulate. This matches how work actually flows.

## Anti-Pattern: Over-Categorization

Don't create subcategories within PARA. Keep it flat.

If you can't decide where something goes, it probably goes in Resources.
