# Reversibility-Calibrated Action

A meta-framework for knowing when to move fast vs. slow: calibrate effort to reversibility.

---

## The Pattern

Across Decision Frameworks, Design Principles, and AI-Assisted Development, the same principle recurs: **the appropriate speed of action depends on how reversible the decision is.**

| Domain | Concept | The Principle |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Decisions | [[Two-Way Doors]] | Move fast on reversible decisions, slow on irreversible |
| Code | [[Steel Thread Delivery]] | Ship thin slices that can be iterated (reversible) |
| AI Development | "Ship ugly and fast" | Prototypes are inherently reversible |
| Design | [[⚠️ Microservices]] warning | Premature architecture is hard to reverse |
| Philosophy | "Plan slow, act fast" | Planning explores reversibility; action commits |

## The Synthesis

The quality of a decision framework can be measured by how well it distinguishes between what's reversible and what's not—then acts accordingly.

This inverts the common instinct. We often:
- Move slowly on small, reversible things (perfectionism)
- Move quickly on large, irreversible things (pressure, momentum)

The principle says: **do the opposite.**

## Application

Before acting, ask:

1. **If this fails, can we undo it?** → Move fast
2. **If this fails, are we stuck with it?** → Slow down, get clarity
3. **Can we make this more reversible?** → Ship a smaller version first

The goal isn't to avoid mistakes — it's to make mistakes cheap.

## The Bike Principle

[[The Collapse of Roles and Time]] applies this framework to AI adoption through the "Kids on a Bike" metaphor:

> A bike is harder to balance when moving slowly. Speed creates stability.

The intuition "slow = safe" is exactly wrong. Learning AI is reversible — you can adjust workflows, change tools, refine approaches. Therefore the framework says **move fast**. The cost of moving slowly (falling behind, no compound learning) exceeds the cost of mistakes (which are cheap to correct).

This connects back to [[Rules of Thumb]]: "If a decision is not permanent, it is better to move too fast."

## Connection to Other Syntheses

This is one of three related frameworks about **resource allocation under uncertainty**:

| Synthesis | Allocates... | Based on... |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Reversibility-Calibrated Action** | Speed | Cost of mistakes |
| [[Leverage Selection]] | Effort | Impact level |
| [[Signal in the Scar]] | Visibility | Value of learning |

**The unified stance:** Act quickly on reversible things, intervene at high leverage points, and make your learning visible.
