# TOSCA Framework

A framework for defining problems clearly before attempting solutions.

> **If I can't state the problem in a clear and precise way, I don't understand it properly.**

## The Framework

### T — Trouble
What is actually wrong? What's the pain?

### O — Owner
Who owns this problem? Who has the authority and accountability to solve it?

### S — Success
What does "solved" look like? How will we know we're done?

### C — Constraints
What limits exist? Budget, time, technology, politics, skills?

### A — Actors
Who is involved? Stakeholders, users, decision-makers, blockers?

## Why This Matters

Most failed solutions come from poorly defined problems.

- Jumping to solutions feels productive
- But solving the wrong problem wastes everything
- Clear problem definition is half the solution

## Using TOSCA

### Before a Project
Write one paragraph answering each letter. If you can't, you're not ready to start.

### During a Meeting
When discussion goes circular, return to TOSCA. Which element is unclear?

### For Technical Decisions
- Trouble: What's the actual technical pain?
- Owner: Who decides the architecture?
- Success: What metrics prove we're better?
- Constraints: What can't we change?
- Actors: Who's affected?
