# Logical Fallacies

Thinking errors that lead to bad decisions.

---

## Distinction Without Difference

> A type of logical fallacy where an author or speaker attempts to describe a distinction between two things where no discernible difference exists.

### In Tech

- "We're not doing microservices, we're doing service-oriented architecture"
- "It's not technical debt, it's deferred refactoring"
- "We're agile, just not doing Scrum"

### The Problem

Creating false distinctions:
- Wastes time on semantics
- Obscures the real issue
- Lets people avoid accountability

## Common Fallacies in Technical Decisions

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
"We've invested so much already, we can't stop now."

The past investment is irrelevant to future decisions. Only future costs and benefits matter.

### Appeal to Authority
"Google does it this way."

Google's context is not your context. What works at their scale may harm at yours.

### False Dilemma
"We either go all-in on microservices OR stay with the monolith."

Most choices have more than two options. The framing is often wrong.

### Survivorship Bias
"All successful startups use X technology."

You don't see the failures that also used X. Success requires more than technology choice.

### Cargo Cult
"Let's adopt their process since they're successful."

Copying visible practices without understanding underlying principles.

## Defending Against Fallacies

1. **Name the fallacy** — Recognition is half the battle
2. **Return to TOSCA** — What's the actual problem?
3. **Ask "What would change my mind?"** — Tests for genuine reasoning
4. **Seek disconfirming evidence** — Fight confirmation bias
