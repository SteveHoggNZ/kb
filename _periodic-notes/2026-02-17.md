## New Notes Added

### [[concepts/ai-development/Trinity Protocol|Trinity Protocol]]
Multi-agent coordination framework built on three primitives: **Semaphore** (state — `_data` frames), **Bell** (signal — mentions), **Watchdog** (entropy — timers). One Law: "Show and Tell" — patch state AND mention next agent. Physics backstops: Watchdog timers fire if no mention arrives, Sticky Streams auto-coalesce entries within 3s window. Born from a real failure where SSE-enabled agent skipped mention and webhook-only Commander never woke up.

### [[concepts/design-principles/Logical Resource Separation|Logical Resource Separation]]
One env var per concern, not one env var per server. Even when sharing one physical Redis/DB/S3, give each logical function its own connection string. Future scaling becomes config, not code. Extracted from Redis configuration review — applies to databases, buckets, API keys, anything where two features would benefit from different scaling policies.

### [[concepts/design-principles/Agent Ergonomics|Agent Ergonomics]]
Cockpit shape coding applied to software. Aircraft controls use different shapes, colours, and textures so pilots can identify them without looking — three senses converge to make the correct action intuitive. Introduces **Affordance** as the middle layer between Law and Physics. Two dimensions: **Human→Agent** (interaction modes, feedback shapes, error recovery) and **Agent→Tool** (distinct tool names, parameter shapes, response structures). Includes the Blindfold Test, Swap Test, and Pressure Test.
