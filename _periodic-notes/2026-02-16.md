## KB Maintenance

Restructured notes to move related links closer to the concepts they reference, rather than having disjointed lists at the bottom.

**Files updated:**

- [[Reversibility-Calibrated Action]] — Added "The Bike Principle" section explaining the connection to [[The Collapse of Roles and Time]] and [[Rules of Thumb]] in context
- [[Rules of Thumb]] — Wove reversibility links into "On Speed" section; transformed Related Concepts into "When Heuristics Fail" with explanatory context
- [[The Collapse of Roles and Time]] — Added Rules of Thumb quote to Bike Principle section; removed redundant list (Connection to Other Concepts section already had contextual links)
- [[Teach the Delta]] — Added [[The Collapse of Roles and Time]] to Connection section
- [[Context Distillation Loop - amnesia as a feature]] — Added missing connections (Teach the Delta, Leverage Selection, The 2026 Builder Operating System, Scarcity to Abundance) to Connection section

**Pattern established:** Links belong in contextual sections that explain *why* the connection matters. Keep only minimal "See Also" for MOC navigation.

## Meta

Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to document rules for AI agents working on this KB. Key principle: links close to definitions, not at the bottom.
