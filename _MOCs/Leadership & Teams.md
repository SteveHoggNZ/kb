How to lead people and build effective teams.

## The CTO's 4 Ts

> The most important job of a CTO or Head of Engineering is building the 4 T's.

### [[concepts/leadership/The Four Ts|Team, Tech, Tools, Timing]]

1. **Team** — Attract great talent. Have a great story. Work with founders to understand the 2-year vision.

2. **Tech** — Every company starts with a monolith (smart thing to do). Know when to break it, how much to break.

3. **Tools** — Focus on how teams communicate, how work gets done, how progress is shown. At early stage, work directly with founders.

4. **Timing** — Know when to scale. Before hiring the next 25 engineers, get culture, tech, and processes right. **Scale Responsibly.**

## Delegation & Accountability

### [[concepts/leadership/Monkey Management|Monkey Management]]
Who has the monkey? The classic HBR framework for delegation. When someone brings you a problem, make sure they leave with the next action—not you. Push initiative to levels 4 and 5: "act then report" and "act independently."

## Performance & Growth

### [[concepts/leadership/Performance Reviews Alternative|Learning-Based Performance]]
Move away from traditional reviews toward continuous growth conversations.

### [[concepts/leadership/Career Advice|Career Wisdom]]
- Plan with patience, execute with impatience
- Run towards something, not away from something
- In interviews: have a conversation, not an interrogation
- Be memorable, not just smart
- Be the most helpful person in the room, not the most talented
- Family first, work next—we're replaceable at work

## Management Anti-Patterns

### [[concepts/leadership/Six Phrases to Stop Using|6 Phrases to Stop Using]]
Things managers say that hurt team effectiveness.

### [[concepts/leadership/⚠️ Scrum Critique|⚠️ Anti-Pattern: Scrum]]
Scrum is a perverted implementation of agile philosophy masquerading as best practice.

- Scrum is for assembly-line work, not knowledge work
- Daily standups are synchronous interruptions solving an async problem
- Story points become a performance metric (defeating their purpose)
- Sprint ceremonies consume 10-20% of engineering time
- Detectives, brokers, lawyers are agile without scrum—so can we

**What to do instead:**
- Async written updates (weekly bullet points)
- Trust the team to self-organize
- Jira/Linear for tracking without the ritual
- Measure outcomes, not velocity

## Organizational Design

### [[concepts/leadership/Product vs Project|Separate Product and Project Delivery]]
Different mindsets for different work. Don't conflate them.

### [[concepts/leadership/Conway's Law|Conway's Law]]
Architecture mirrors organization. Design your teams to match desired architecture.

### [[concepts/leadership/DevOps vs SRE vs Platform Engineering|DevOps → SRE → Platform Engineering]]
The evolution of "who runs production." DevOps is a formation, not a position. SRE adds engineering discipline. Platform Engineering provides self-service golden paths.

### [[concepts/leadership/The Process Is Not The Product|Process vs. Product Thinking]]
Don't confuse following a process with delivering value.

---

## Systems Thinking

### [[concepts/leadership/Systems Thinking Levels|Four Levels of Leverage]]
Events → Patterns → Systems Structure → Mental Models. The higher you lead, the more you operate at levels 3 and 4. Change the mental model, change everything downstream.

---

## Team Practices

### [[concepts/leadership/Meeting Check-Ins|Meeting Check-Ins (Green-Yellow-Red)]]
Plan for the inevitable: humans show up distracted sometimes. Quick color check-in acknowledges reality and creates space for the human condition.

---

## Building High-Performance Teams

### Cultural Manifesto Elements
- Autotomy: teams can shed parts to survive
- Guardrails: boundaries that enable freedom
- Degrees of Freedom: how much latitude teams have

### Books to Read
- The Phoenix Project
- Team Topologies
- Accelerate

---

## Synthesis

### [[concepts/leadership/Leverage Selection|Leverage Selection]]
The meta-skill: recognizing which level of the system to intervene at. Actions → Behaviors → Structures → Mental Models. Higher levels have more leverage. Fixing the bug (event) vs. changing the process (structure). The most valuable skill isn't solving problems — it's knowing *where* to apply effort.
