Wisdom for living and working well.

## Purpose & Meaning

### [[concepts/philosophy/Ikigai|Ikigai]]
The Japanese concept of "reason for being"—the intersection of:
- What you love
- What you're good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

### [[concepts/philosophy/Mastery|The Path to Mastery]]
Long-term thinking about skill development and expertise.

---

## Core Principles

### [[concepts/philosophy/Preparation Meets Opportunity|Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity]]
> This quote, attributed to Roman philosopher Seneca, reminds us that we make our own luck.

We don't control opportunity, but we control preparation.

### [[concepts/philosophy/Running Towards|Run Towards Something, Not Away]]
Career moves should be driven by attraction to something better, not escape from something bad.

### [[concepts/philosophy/Family First|Family First, Work Next]]
> We are replaceable when it comes to work, but there's no replacement for family lost.

Prioritize accordingly.

---

## Decision-Making Mindset

### [[concepts/philosophy/Speed of Decisions|Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions]]
> If a decision is not permanent, it is better to move too fast.
> If a decision is permanent, it is better to move too slow.

Two-way doors vs. one-way doors (Amazon's framework).

### [[concepts/philosophy/Plan vs Execute|Plan with Patience, Execute with Impatience]]
Take time to think, but act decisively once committed.

---

## Productivity & Work

### [[concepts/philosophy/Building a Second Brain|Building a Second Brain (PARA)]]
Tiago Forte's system for organizing knowledge:

**CODE Method:**
- **C**ollect
- **O**rganize
- **D**istill
- **E**xpress

**PARA Structure:**
- **P**rojects - Active work with deadlines
- **A**reas - Ongoing responsibilities
- **R**esources - Topics of interest
- **A**rchives - Completed/inactive

### [[concepts/philosophy/Productivity Framework|Productivity Framework]]
Principles for getting meaningful work done.

---

## Presence & Perception

### [[concepts/philosophy/Being Helpful|Be the Most Helpful, Not the Most Talented]]
> You ought not to be perceived "the most talented person" in the room.
> You ought to be perceived "the most helpful person" in the room.

### [[concepts/philosophy/Memorable Not Smart|Be Memorable, Not Just Smart]]
In interviews and relationships, connection beats credentials.

### [[concepts/philosophy/Conversation Not Interrogation|Have Conversations, Not Interrogations]]
Applies to interviews, meetings, and relationships.

---

## Wisdom Traditions

### [[concepts/philosophy/Kintsugi|Kintsugi]] (金継ぎ)
The Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold. Breakage becomes beauty. Scars tell stories. Failure is transformation, not shame.

### Stoicism
- Focus on what you control
- Preparation over luck
- See: [[concepts/philosophy/Preparation Meets Opportunity]]

### Minimalism
- Fewer things, better things
- Related to: [[Design Principles]] (simplicity in code)

---

## Synthesis

### [[concepts/philosophy/Signal in the Scar|Signal in the Scar]]
The Kintsugi principle applied everywhere: what we instinctively hide (failures, imperfection, unfinished work) often contains the most valuable signal. Technical debt isn't shame — it's evidence of shipping. Showing raw work creates trust. The instinct to conceal is itself the problem.
