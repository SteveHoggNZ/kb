## Organization Principles

This knowledge base follows a **MOC (Map of Content)** structure:

1. **MOCs are hubs** - They link to related concepts and provide context
2. **Concepts link to each other** - Ideas connect across domains
3. **Reference stays flat** - Technical notes organized by technology
4. **Backlinks reveal connections** - Use Obsidian's graph view to discover relationships

> "The value of a note is in its connections, not just its content."
